    <header> <h1>Project Overview</h1></header>
    <p>For this assignment, I was tasked to create a list-based interface that would allow users to select items out of a given list and aggregate them. Additionally, this site was to allow users to filter based on two separate criteria and sort based on one.

            <h3>Summary of Findings</h3>
            <p>
                The three websites I chose all have major differences in their favoriting function. IMDb had a clear visual hierarchy when it came to navigating the sorting and filtering functions. Overall, it had relevant preset sorting and filtering features. The sorting feature appears as a dropdown menu, but it does not allow combining two or more separate sorting selections. The two music sites I chose were less successful in terms of sorting and filtering, but Spotify also had a clear visual hierarchy which made using its features easy to use. The most successful factor in the Spotify favoriting function was the ability to sort alphabetically with any sorting selection. For Soundcloud, the “filter” function was not a filter after all but a search feature that did not work for all but one of the songs in my favorites. I also was not able to sort.

            <h3>Designs to implement based on analysis</h3>
            <p>I like the idea of having filtering and sorting work in conjunction for users. IMDb.com was a prime example of this. I would like to have filtering features that work well with the sorting feature. For example, if I choose to filter by a price range of $0 - $10, I would want to be able to sort in ascending price order to see cheaper options first and be able to scroll down to more expensive options. </p>
            <h2>Functionality</h2>
            <p> I decided to focus on an Album website. This interface would act as an online shopping platform for users to browse available vinyls and add selected vinyls to their cart. In this, I decided to add a filter to sort by genre and another filter to sort by price. Additionally, I chose to sort based on price in ascending order. Users are able to modify filters and sorting by clicking on respective buttons and can add and remove items from their cart. The cart also has a feature that allows users to reset their additions and has a running total of the vinyls “to be purchased.”</p>
